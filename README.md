# Functional programming

## Concept
This repo has 2 different projects: EnqueteData & RDWData.

### EnqueteData
In EnqueteData I am writing a simple project where I gather the data from a dataset from a json file. The user can receive certain columns from the dataset by using the textbox on the HTMLpage. After the user typed his or her query, the program will then check if the user typed a valid input. If the input is valid, the program will try to 'clean' the data. Empty values, wrong format values and whitespaces will be fixed. If the program is unable to fix a certain value, the program will return a warning but continue with the other values. That way the user will still receive his or her preferred column.

### RDWData
I am writing a simple project where I am practising with receiving data from an api. I'm using the same html and textinput from my previous project in this repo. I will try to collect specific columns and clean them. Besides that I will compare columns with eachother to find interesting data. For the data I will be using different api's from RDW. I want to find answers for my main question

I'm planning to make an interactive parkingarea that will visualize per city how many parkingspots are availible for people with a phisical limitation

This was just the beginning of cleaning the RDW-data. Please navigate to my [frontend data](https://github.com/marcoFijan/frontend-data/tree/master/Frontend-Data) section in the repo.

### Research Questions
According to the Central Bureau of Statistics of the Netherlands, a lot of citizenry have one or more phisical limitation. More then 13% has a phisical limitation. Still, according to the RDWDataset, most parkinggarages are not accessible for those citizenry. I want to research how many parkingspots are availible per province, and how many are required in percentage according to the numbers of the Central Bureau of Statistics.

To begin my research, I set up a series of questions:
#### Main Research Question:
Which province in the Netherlands is the best province to live for people with a phisical limitation when you look at the accessibility of parkingspots?

#### Supporting sub-Questions
* What is the ratio of the overall capacity and availible parking spaces for people with a disability per province?
* What is the ratio of the total number of parking garages and accessible parking garages for people with a disability per province?
* What is the percentage of people with a physical disability per province?

### Sketch of my concept
I want to visualize the accessibility with percentages of availible parking spaces. I want to use a parkingarea and color these according to their accessibility:

### Necessities
Before I can visualize my concept, I need to collect the data that I need:

#### [Dataset: Specificaties parkeergebied](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-SPECIFICATIES-PARKEERGEBIED/b3us-f26s/data)
Columns: **AreaId**, **AreaManagerId**, **Capaciteit** and **DisabledAccess**

With these columns I can receive the following data:
* Capacity per parkinggarage
* Accessibility of parkinggarage for disabled people


#### [Dataset: Parkeeradres](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-PARKEERADRES/ygq4-hh5q/data)
Columns: **ParkingAdressReference**, **Province**

With these columns I can receive the following data:
* Province of parkinggarage

#### [Dataset: Gezondheidsmonitor 2016](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/83674NED/table?ts=1603802188621)
Columns: **Filter: Leeftijd=Totaal**, **Provincie**, **Functiebeperking**

With these columns I can receive the following data:
* Percentage of people with a phisical limitation

## Features

### EnqueteData
As of now, this project has the following features:
* User can give input on which column he or she wants to see in the console
[![1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/MT6nVypX/1.png)](https://postimg.cc/Tys2X5mX)
* UserInput will be checked and converted to a valid input if possible
[![2.png](https://i.postimg.cc/7PQ5JJ8Y/2.png)](https://postimg.cc/CdkhW1xW)
* The column 'oogKleur' will be coverted and cleaned into usable data
[![3.png](https://i.postimg.cc/vmMTwW9X/3.png)](https://postimg.cc/jDgtznMJ)

### RDWData
As of now, this project has the following features:
* Project will make a connection to an api from RDW
* User can give input on which column he or she wants to see in the console

## Data used

### EnqueteData
For this project I am using a dataset of an enquÃ«te from Datavisualisatie 2. This dataset contains several interesting insights about CMD-students. This dataset has been created by Jan-Jaap Rijpkema and converted into json by Jonah Meijers.
The data for this dataset has been collected in September from CMD-students who are in the beginning of their third year.

### RDWData
Aw of now, the only data used in this project is one api from RDW with specific data of parkingarea's (capacity, maximum height, maximum weight etc...)
[RDWData: Parking Specifications API](https://opendata.rdw.nl/resource/b3us-f26s.json)

## How to install and use
### OPTION 1: Cloning git
To try this project for yourself, you can clone the github repo to your locale machine. Just follow these steps
#### STEP 1: Create your local git repository
