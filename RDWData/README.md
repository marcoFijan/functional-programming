## Concept
In which city in the Netherlands is the best city to live for people with a phisical limitation?

I am writing a simple project where I am practising with receiving data from an api. I'm using the same html and textinput from my previous project in this repo. I will try to collect specific columns and clean them. Besides that I will compare columns with eachother to find interesting data. For the data I will be using different api's from RDW. I want to find answers for my main question

I'm planning to make an interactive parkingarea that will visualize per city how many parkingspots are availible for people with a phisical limitation

### Sketch of my concept

## Features
As of now, this project has the following features:
* Project will make a connection to an api from RDW
* User can give input on which column he or she wants to see in the console

## Data used
Aw of now, the only data used in this project is one api from RDW with specific data of parkingarea's (capacity, maximum height, maximum weight etc...)


## How to install and use
### OPTION 1: Cloning git
To try this project for yourself, you can clone the github repo to your locale machine. Just follow these steps
#### STEP 1: Create your local git repository

```
git init
```

#### STEP 2: git clone
To clone this project and receive it on your locale machine, use this command
```
